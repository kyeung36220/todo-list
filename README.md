A project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list) where we made a To-Do list website using Webpacks, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Cool Features
- Local Storage: Data is locally stored in computer. So if you refresh or close window, your tasks and projects are saved!
- Light/Dark Mode: You can toggle Light and Dark Modes for better user experience.
- Sorting: Tasks can be sorted in ascending and descending order by Name, Due Date, and Priority.
